i want you to use manim and create the following animations for me, make sure that thet look proper and are propely formatted and elements are wisely placed, so no elements overlap or look messy
i want to show the working of how a transformer works in steps
1. take a input sentence (I am a human being) and then tokenize it into words
2. take each token and embed it to make a matrix, label each columns according to the word, also add positional encodings
3. take the matrix and then pass it through a plane (label it attention) to output 3 matrices Q,K,V then show how Attention is found for that head (the multiplication)
4. take multiple such planes and stack them in 3d and pass it through the block to show multihead attention and then show its concated output and label it as attended output
5. take the attended output and then pass it through a feed forward network to get a matrix
6. show a static image with all the elements and call it encoder block 
explicitly show each and every detail and element as i have mentioned
